# Introduction 
This Repo is a collation of matierial I have created and used during my working career. It is still a work in progress, will be udpating regularly. Some of the resources within the repo are:
- Landing Zone Deployments
- Useful Powershell Scripts
- YAML pipeline explanation
- ARM templates have been broken down to explain resources and any smart logical fuctions used.

2.	LZ-Terraform:
