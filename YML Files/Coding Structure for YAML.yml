# Objects and their properties are defined by an indent. for example below, I have created the person property and I have properties indented following it. 
# In contrast to JSON properties to do not require "" '' however you can use them if you prefer

  # You can create a list also known as an array using using a few methods lets see below some examples
  hobbies:                                          # This is a basic sort of list similar to a bullet point setup (much easier to read than the traditional Array list in JSOn which we will see)
    - gaming
    - chilling
    - learning
  movies: ["Bad Boys", "Friday" , "Rush Hour"]      # You can also create an array list similar to JSON 
  
  friends:                                          # here i will make a list within a value of an object, so essentially a further array of values per object within an object there are 3 ways:
    - name: "John"                                  
    - age: 30                                       # the 1st way is simple you add the hyphen and add in values per line as the hobbies
    - {name: "Smith", age: 30}                      # the 2nd way you use curly brackets {} and quotation marks ""
    - 
      name: "James"                                 # the 3rd wqay uoy you leave the inden blank and hit enter then you can add in the values. 
      age: 30

# this is how to deal with large text files and to format them

# Within Yaml you can reference variables and objects with 2 symbols the & and * lets see an example below:
login credentials:
  Username: User1
  password: &password NotASecurePassword

userid: User1
password: *password                         # this will automatically fill in "NotASecurePassword" , If I was to change the &password property then it wall update the *password

# You can also reference key value pairs, this is done:

base: &base                                   # &base is set to create the reference object and its values are var1: value1
  var1: value1

foo:                                          # lets say foo is another object you have made and now you want to include var1: value1 within it
  <<: *base                                   # this will automatically fill in var1: value1
  var2: value2
